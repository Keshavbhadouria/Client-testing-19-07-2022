								<p>This establishment strives to treat all clients at their scheduled times. Keeping your appointments allows for better results because you are able to stay on your hair growth schedule. Additionally, no-shows block out otherwise available slots for other clients to get in to stay on their treatment schedules. Clients must provide 24 hours notice if they need to reschedule or are unable to make their appointment. <p>
								<ul>
									<li>Clients must pay a $25.00 “no show” / “late cancellation” fee if they miss an appointment or do not	give 24 hours notice of a cancellation or re-schedule.</li>
									<li>If the provided credit card declines, This establishment will penalize by applying the treatment areas scheduled on the day of the no-show as used.</li>
								</ul>
								<h5 class ="H5 mt-4" >*As a courtesy to our clients we try to send out email and text reminders. However, not receiving those reminders will not excuse a missed appointment.</h5>
