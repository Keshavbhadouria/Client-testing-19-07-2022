               <p class = "px-3 mx-md-3">My signature below certifies that I hereby seek the services of -------, and its employees, independent contractors,
                  associates, agents and representatives (collectively and hereby known as, “------- ”,) for laser, collagen induction 
                  therapy and/or dermatological care. I understand that microneedling and laser treatments, such as hair reduction, are 
                  voluntary procedures and are not covered by Medicare, Medicaid, Medi-Cal, HMO, PPO, or  private insurance plans. I understand
                  that ------ will not submit any claims to any insurance carriers. I understand that payment is due before services are rendered. 
                  I also understand and agree that if I pay for a package of services using a credit card, check or finance company and the payment is not 
                  honored or is subject to a chargeback at any time for any reason that I am still fully responsible for payment for the treatments I 
                  receive and agree to pay for them at the undiscounted (“pay as you go”) rate. I agree to pay a fee of $25.00 for each check or charge
                  that is not honored by my bank. Lastly, I fully acknowledge that I am personally responsible for all fees and charges incurred in connection
                  with my purchase and I completely understand that there is absolutely NO refunding of any patient fees, payments, charges, credit, gift 
                  certificates, product purchases or pre-paid packages.
