                     <p>Our office is committed to protecting the privacy of your medical information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (and updated in 2013) is a federal law that governs the use and disclosure of a personʼs health information. Our “Notice of Privacy Practices” provides information about how we may use and disclose protected health information about you. The Notice contains a “Patient Rights” section describing your rights under the law. The following statements cover the basics of your rights as a patient under HIPAA:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Our office has a “Notice of Privacy Practices” and you have the right to review a detailed copy of our Notice before signing this HIPAA Patient Consent.</li>
                        <li>This “Notice of Privacy Practices” is available in our offices.</li>
                        <li>Protected health information may be disclosed for treatment, payment, or health care operations.</li>
                        <li>We reserve the right to change the terms of our “Notice of Privacy Practices” at any time.</li>
                        <li>If we change our Notice, you may obtain a revised copy by contacting our office.</li>
                        <li>You have the right to restrict the uses of your protected health information.</li>
                        <li>You may revoke this HIPAA Consent in writing at any time. However, such a revocation shall not affect</li>
                        any disclosures we have already made in reliance on your prior Consent.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Additionally, it is the policy of this office to remind patients of their appointments. We may do this via live telephone calls, automated (TeleVox) appointment reminder calls, text messages, e-mails, U.S mail, social media or by any means convenient to the practice. We may also send you other communications informing you of changes to office policy, new technology and specials that you might find valuable or informative. That said, contact will only come directly from us; we will never sell or trade your private information including phone numbers, e-mail address or mailing addresses. You may opt out of any or all communication measures any time by contacting us in writing.</p>
                     <p>By signing the next page of this document, you certify that you have read our HIPAA Patient Consent and have had the opportunity to review a more detailed version if so desired. Your signature also signifies that you agree with the above statements and this policy. This establishment provides this form and information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (updated in 2013).</p>
                     <h2 class = "text-center H2 my-4">TELEHEALTH (TELEMEDICINE) CONSENT and VIDEO/PHOTO AGREEMENT</h2>
                     <p>My signature below certifies that I understand, agree and consent that this establishment and its employees, independent contractors, associates, agents, sister facilities and representatives (collectively and hereby known as, “MEDSPA”,) may take photographs and/or use video (for “store & forward” or teleconferencing technology) of the area to be treated before initial treatment begins & at some or all reoccurring visits (genital area photos and videos are usually NOT taken). These recordings will be available only to our medical staff members to assess the patient and track the progression of each treatment and are part of the medical record. MEDSPA follows extremely strict HIPPA guidelines regarding patient confidentiality and privacy & therefore names and recordings are used internally and only the treated area/area to be assessed will be shown in these photographs & videos.</p>
